### Get Subscription by Offering Discount Coupons

Tempt your store visitors to subscribe by offering them static or auto-generated coupon codes in exchange. Display coupons directly on popups or send via email, so customers do not lose them. You can also take advantage of the built-in Magento 2 Shopping Cart Price Rules and generate a custom coupon format for every popup.

### Keep Track of Popup Statistics & Measure Success

With the help of a statistics grid, conveniently run A/B tests and detect which popup is the most successful. There, you can track popup Views, Subscriptions, and hence Conversion Rates, as well as Оrders Count and Total Revenue.
